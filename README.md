Java Server for Strangebrew Elsinore

The purpose of this project is to create a Java application that can run on small systems such as the RaspberryPi and the Beaglebone series

Since these systems run on Linux, that is a requirement to using this.

The system is based off the Dallas One Wire protocol for the temperature probes (expanding to analogue inputs too), and Straightforward GPIO outputs for SSR control

Please refer to this [site](http://dougedey.github.io/SB_Elsinore_Server/) for documentation
