  - Avoid articles (the, a, an) to keep content short and actionable
  - Be written in sentence case (first word capitalized, the rest is lowercase)

### Shortcut description

The shortcut description should describe what action will be taken if merchants tap certain keys. When a hotkey combination takes merchants to a location in the interface, the format should be:
