# Badge

Badges are used to inform merchants of the status of a piece of information or of an action that’s been taken. For example, when a customer has received the item they purchased from a merchant, a badge that says “Completed” shows next to the order number.

---

## Best practices

Great badges benefit merchants by:

- Using established color patterns so that merchants can quickly identify their status or importance level
- Being clearly labeled with short, scannable text
- Being positioned to clearly identify the object they’re informing or labelling (e.g. an order)

---

## Content guidelines

### Badge label

Badge labels should:

- Use a single word to describe the status of an object.
- Only use two words if you need to describe a complex state. For example, “Partially refunded” and “Partially fulfilled”.
- Always describe the status in the past tense. For example, refunded not refund.

The available badges for financial status are:

- Authorized
- Pending
- Paid
- Unpaid
- Pending
- Voided
- Partially paid
- Partially refunded
- Refunded

The available badges for fulfillment status are:

- Fulfilled
- Complete
- Partial
- Unfulfilled
- Restocked

#### Don’t

Don’t use alternatives to existing badge options. Only create a new badge option if there aren’t any existing options to communicate the status you need.

## Examples

### Default badge

Use to give a non-critical status update on a piece of information or action.

```jsx
<Badge>Fulfilled</Badge>
```

### Informational badge

Use to call out an object or action as having an important attribute. For example, marking an option as “Recommended” or marking a theme as “Published”.

```jsx
<Badge status="info">Published</Badge>
```

### Success badge

Use to indicate a successful, completed, or desirable state when it’s important to provide positive reinforcement to the merchant. For example, when a merchant successfully disputes a chargeback, a success badge shows that says “Funds recovered”.

```jsx
<Badge status="success">Funds recovered</Badge>
```

### Attention badge

Use when something requires a merchant’s attention but the issue isn’t critical. For example, this badge would show next to an order that needs to be reviewed by the merchant.

```jsx
<Badge status="attention">Unfulfilled</Badge>
```

### Warning badge

Use for the most critical and time sensitive issues that require a merchant’s attention. Keep in mind that seeing this badge can feel stressful for merchants so it should be used when absolutely necessary.

```jsx
<Badge status="warning">SSL unavailable</Badge>
```

### Incomplete badge

Use to indicate when a given task has not yet been completed. For example, when a merchant hasn’t fulfilled an order.

```jsx
<Badge progress="incomplete">Unfulfilled</Badge>
```

### Partially complete badge

Use to indicate when a given task has been partially completed. For example, when a merchant has partially fulfilled an order.

```jsx
<Badge progress="partiallyComplete">Partially fulfilled</Badge>
```

### Complete badge

Use to indicate when a given task has been completed. For example, when a merchant has fulfilled an order.

```jsx
<Badge progress="complete">Fulfilled</Badge>
```
