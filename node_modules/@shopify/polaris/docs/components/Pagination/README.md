# Pagination

Use pagination to allow navigation between pages that represent an ordered collection of items.

---

## Best practices

Pagination should:

- Be placed at the bottom of a long list that has been split up into pages
- Navigate to the previous and next set of items in a paged list
- Be placed in the page header on detail pages (e.g. detail page for a product or order)
- Navigate to the previous and next object of the same type (e.g. product or order) on a detail page
- Hint when the merchants is at the first or the last page by disabling the corresponding button

## Content guidelines

There are no editable content elements that are specific to the pagination component.

## Examples

### Default pagination

Use for pagination at the bottom of lists.

```jsx
<Pagination
  hasPrevious
  onPrevious={() => {
    console.log('Previous');
  }}
  hasNext
  onNext={() => {
    console.log('Next');
  }}
/>
```
