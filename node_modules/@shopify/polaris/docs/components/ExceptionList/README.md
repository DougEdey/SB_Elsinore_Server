# Exception list

Use exception lists to help merchants notice important, standout information that adds extra context to a task. Exception lists often consist of a title and description. Each item in the list either has a bullet or icon at the front.

---

## Best practices

The exception list component should:

- Be attached to another component
- Inform merchants about extra context that will help them make better decisions
- Only surface noteworthy, actionable content, like a high risk order or out of stock item
- Used sparingly, so that it has more impact and doesn’t add clutter
- Only use an icon if it adds clarity to the content or helps the merchant visualize the meaning

### Opportunity for improvement

Exception lists aren’t clickable. If you’re a partner and have an idea that could make this component better, reach out to us on our [public repo](https://github.com/shopify/polaris/issues). If you work for Shopify, reach out to the Polaris team on our internal Polaris GitHub repo.

## Content guidelines

Exception lists should:

- Highlight an exceptional state that helps the merchant make a decision
- Use the appropriate [color](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/colors) to suit the tone of the message
- Have a description (a title is optional)
- Be concise

For error states, exception lists should:

- Either tell the merchant how to solve the problem or be attached to an item that lets the merchant fix the problem

If placed next to an item in a [resource list](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists-and-tables/resource-list), exceptions lists should:

- Make the entire list item clickable because the exception list itself isn’t clickable
